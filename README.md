Let’s we build Vue App that call API backend, along with JWT authentication Pinia for state management and Vuetify for mobile responsiveness.

If you’re building a modern Vue 3 frontend and want to add a clean login page with Vuetify and manage the authentication state using Pinia, this article is for you. We’ll walk through a simple login form that call API and send credentials to a Go backend, receives a JWT token, and handles user session state globally using Pinia.

This repo is sample code for article : https://novrian.substack.com/publish/posts/detail/165696234/share-center
